## The Article
The article I used was [Five Myths of Testing by a Software QA](https://medium.com/cermati-tech/five-myths-of-testing-by-a-software-qa-27edb179fad).

I found this article to be a good read because my past two internships have consisted of QA roles. It was interesting to see what professionals in the QA industry had to say. I was also curious to know what the five myths are. 

The article brought two myths up that I found to be very true. 

>**QA specialists aren’t needed, developers can do the testing just fine**

>Some people think that the role of software QA testers in the development life cycle depends on company size. At smaller companies, all of the testing process can be done by their developers. This is correct, but what if the developers have a bunch of tasks with tight deadlines? They might not be able to concentrate on performing detailed regression tests while also facing the repetitiveness of smoke tests.


I saw this to be very true at the company I worked for. The developers always had their hands full with getting features done for the product owners. It was beneficial to have a QA department to perform proper testing that isn't rushed.

>**Automated testing is more powerful than manual testing**

>I think 100% automation on QA isn’t very feasible. Human touch is required to see and feel if the UI/UX is good enough for users. We need humans to make sure a button positioning is right.

Manual testing is often looked down on in the QA field because it is slow and repetitve. However, testing cannot be 100% automation. I also agree with the article, stating that testing is important to feel if the UI/UX is good enough for users. 

It was really refreshing to see these myths debunked in this article. Definitely a read I recommend if you're interested in QA!
